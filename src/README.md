# READ ME

Facilitate development by creating pre-defined classes to handle database connections and query manipulations.
It doesn't contain much at the moment as I am working on other projects, but I'll make updates along the way (whenever I'm free that is).
My goal is to make work with any basic javafx or regular java cli operations project out there respecting these simple rules:

1. Create database, tables..
2. Insert
3. Select
4. Update
5. Delete

###### 3. Query (Class)
